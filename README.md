# CreativeCV
Project for a seminar class: Creative thinking and problem solving.
The program is based on Machine learning algorithm in Python, that detects the face of the employee, recognizes the face and if the face detected matches the name of the employee,  the program starts running(similar to the face password). The program navigates through the different cv sections (technical skills, educational background, etc.) according to the employers input.
